# here's a title

This is a sample post of mine. I'm going to test out a whole bunch of things. For example, my `vscode` settings, and also another example, the inline code word I just used.

Also here's a python snippet:

```python
import foo, omg

@omg(title='baz')
def bar(baz, qux):
    if isinstance(baz, qux):
        print('OMG')
```

It would also be nice to check out some bulleted lists:

* like this one
* or this other one
  * and this should nest under
  * another nested one
* after nested

## here's a subtitle

Well, what else should I check? Not really sure to be honest.

Let's try a table

| Field 1    | Field 2      |
| ---------- | -------------|
| what do we | have here    |
| `markedup` | another one  |
| not bad    |              |

And let's quote someone too:

> Once upon a time, they lived happily ever after.

Adding a horizontal rule:

And I think I'm done!
