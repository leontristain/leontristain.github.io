## Ingredients

* Roasted Duck
* Noodles
* Yu Choy
* Green Onions
* Ginger
* Garlic
* Cilantro
* Better Than Bullion (Roasted Chicken Base)
* Shin Ramyun Seasoning Packet
* Soy Sauce
* Sesame Oil
* Vegetable Oil

## Instructions

### Shopping and Prep

Roasted duck can be bought from Asian supermarkets or Cantonese BBQ joints. Typically you can buy a half duck or full duck. They will chop it into pieces and package it up for you. Later when you get home, you'll want to hand-shred and debone the duck so you don't have to deal with tiny bone chunks in your noodles. I usually hand-process all the duck, then portion into freezer bags to freeze.

Yu Choy can be bought from Asian supermarkets. They come in large bags of maybe 12-18 bushels. Once taken home, I usually wash them all at once, then chop lengthwise at a slight angle into long thin strips. I chop up all the Yu Choy, then portion into flattened freezer bags, squeezing as much air as I can out before sealing. They go into the fridge and should last through the next week.

You can use any style Asian noodle I imagine. I tend to buy freshly-made Shanghai Noodles from my local Asian supermarket. Shanghai noodles can be thick or thin, and I buy the thin kind, but there's no strict requirement. They come in sealed bags where within the bag they are nicely portioned into wads of noodles, where one wad is a good portion for one bowl.

I also like to wash and trim the end of the cilantro ahead of time, to portion into flattened freezer bags. I don't chop them ahead of time.

### Cooking

#### Prep

* Finely chop green onions, ginger, garlic, mix them together
* Roughly chop cilantro and set aside

#### Cook Noodles

* Boil up some water in a small pot (I do so in a kettle before adding to pot because it's faster)
* Dump in the wad of noodles
* Cook until ready (takes about 1-2 minutes with fresh noodles, longer if using some dried noodle - follow instructions on recipe)
* Drain and wash noodles in cold water, then put into bowl

#### Cook Duck

* Defrost the shredded duck packet in microwave
* Heat up a pan, and use it to pan-fry the duck in its own fat for a while until nice and hot
* Once duck is ready, serve duck into the bowl with noodles
* This step should take no more than 2-3 minutes

#### Cook Soup

* In a soup pot, heat up some vegetable oil on medium heat
* Throw in the chopped green onions, ginger, garlic, and fry until garlic takes on slight color
* Add in soy sauce and let it simmer for 10-20 seconds, then add the water for the soup (here I use the remaining water in the kettle I boiled for the noodles; it's already hot so no need to wait for boil again)
* Dump in a packet of prepared Yu Choy
* Stir in a small spoonful of Better Than Bullion
* Add some seasoning from the Shin Ramyun Seasoning Packet - just a little bit, not too much since this can get quite spicy
* Continue to simmer until Yu Choy is cooked through (should take no more than 2-3 minutes overall)
* Turn off the heat, dump in chopped cilantro and pour a small amount of sesame oil, then stir.
* Use chopsticks to fish out most of the solid stuff into noodle bowl, then ladel the soup into noodle bowl to finish it.
* Take pictures and enjoy
