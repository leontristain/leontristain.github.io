## Current Projects

### pyxedit (pyxedit)

A python wrapper to xedit

### NPC Stylizer (npc-stylizer)

A tool that allows users to pick and choose which npc is to be replaced by which
npc replacer mod.

### Skyrim Builder (skyrim-builder)

A tool that attempts a 1-button install of skyrim modlists.

# Current Plan

1. develop pyxedit in conjunction with a npc stylizer script; needs of script dictates pyxedit high level API
2. develop the `npc-facebook.esp` plugin, where on a button push it will take photos of a list of NPCs provided via a text file
3. iterate with npc-stylizer, npc-facebook, and pyxedit until stylizer functionality is all working
4. publish pyxedit 0.1 privately (let ElMinister know about this)
5. officially begin npc-stylizer project to reuse code from the skyrim-builder framework
6. implement UI workflow for npc-stylizer
7. once npc-stylizer is ready for public, announce and publish npc-stylizer together with pyxedit 1.0
8. continue working towards skyrim-builder
